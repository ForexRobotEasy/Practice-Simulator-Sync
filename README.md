# Forex Robot Easy ReadMe File

Forex Robot Easy is a trading algorithm developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This ReadMe file provides an overview of the code and explains how the algorithm works.

## Input Parameters

The algorithm requires the following input parameters:

- **lotSize**: The lot size for trading. Default value is 0.1.
- **stopLoss**: The stop loss in pips. Default value is 50.
- **takeProfit**: The take profit in pips. Default value is 100.

## Global Variables

The algorithm uses the following global variables:

- **ticket**: Order ticket number.
- **entryPrice**: Entry price of the trade.

## Practice Simulator Sync Trading Algorithm

The code provided implements a practice simulator sync trading algorithm. The algorithm works as follows:

1. On each tick, the algorithm checks if there is an open position for the current symbol.
2. If there is an open position, the algorithm checks the type of the position (buy or sell).
3. If the position is a buy trade, the algorithm checks if the price has reached the take profit or stop loss level. If so, it closes the buy position.
4. If the position is a sell trade, the algorithm checks if the price has reached the take profit or stop loss level. If so, it closes the sell position.
5. If there is no open position, the algorithm opens a new buy trade and a new sell trade simultaneously. It sets the order ticket number and entry price for each trade.
